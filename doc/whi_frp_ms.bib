abstract = {Background: The apolipoprotein A5 gene (APOA5) is a major gene that regulates lipid metabolism and is modulated by dietary factors. A novel variant rs964184 in APOA5 was identified to be associated with lipids in genome-wide association studies. Objective: We examined whether this variant modified changes in lipid concentrations in response to a 2-y weight-loss diet intervention in a randomized trial. Design: The current analyses were secondary analyses of a data set from the Pounds Lost Trial. We genotyped APOA5 rs964184 in 734 overweight or obese adults who were randomly assigned to one of 4 diets that differed in percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrate for 2 y. We evaluated changes in fasting serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride from baseline to 2 y of follow-up. Results: After a 2-y dietary intervention, we showed significant interactions between the APOA5 rs964184 polymorphism and dietary fat intake (low compared with high) in the determination of changes in TC, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (P-interaction = 0.007, 0.017, and 0.006, respectively). In the low-fat intake group (20{\%} of energy derived from fat), carriers of the risk allele (G allele) exhibited greater reductions in TC and LDL cholesterol than did noncarriers (P = 0.036 and 0.039, respectively), whereas in the high-fat diet group (40{\%} of energy derived from fat), participants with the G allele had a greater increase in HDL cholesterol than did participants without this allele (P = 0.038). Conclusion: Our data showed better improvement in lipid profiles from long-term low-fat diet intake in the APOA5 rs964184 risk allele. The Pounds Lost Trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00072995. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract = {Levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol are heritable, modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease. To identify new loci and refine known loci influencing these lipids, we examined 188,577 individuals using genome-wide and custom genotyping arrays. We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P {\textless} 5 x 10(-8), including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index. Our results demonstrate the value of using genetic data from individuals of diverse ancestry and provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipids to guide future genetic, biological and therapeutic research.},

abstract = {Genetic and environmental risk factors and their interactions contribute to the development of complex diseases. In this review, we discuss methodological issues involved in investigating gene-environment (G x E) interactions in genetic-epidemiological studies of complex diseases and their potential relevance for clinical application. Although there are some important examples of interactions and applications, the widespread use of the knowledge about G x E interaction for targeted intervention or personalized treatment (pharmacogenetics) is still beyond current means. This is due to the fact that convincing evidence and high predictive or discriminative power are necessary conditions for usefulness in clinical practice. We attempt to clarify conceptual differences of the term 'interaction' in the statistical and biological sciences, since precise definitions are important for the interpretation of results. We argue that the investigation of G x E interactions is more rewarding for the detailed characterization of identified disease genes (ie at advanced stages of genetic research) and the stratified analysis of environmental effects by genotype or vice versa. Advantages and disadvantages of different epidemiological study designs are given and sample size requirements are exemplified. These issues as well as a critical appraisal of common methodological concerns are finally discussed.},

abstract = {CONTEXT The association between coffee intake and risk of myocardial infarction (MI) remains controversial. Coffee is a major source of caffeine, which is metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme. Individuals who are homozygous for the CYP1A2*1A allele are "rapid" caffeine metabolizers, whereas carriers of the variant CYP1A2*1F are "slow" caffeine metabolizers. OBJECTIVE To determine whether CYP1A2 genotype modifies the association between coffee consumption and risk of acute nonfatal MI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cases (n = 2014) with a first acute nonfatal MI and population-based controls (n = 2014) living in Costa Rica between 1994 and 2004, matched for age, sex, and area of residence, were genotyped by restriction fragment-length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the intake of caffeinated coffee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Relative risk of nonfatal MI associated with coffee intake, calculated using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS Fifty-five percent of cases (n = 1114) and 54{\%} of controls (n = 1082) were carriers of the slow *1F allele. For carriers of the slow *1F allele, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) of nonfatal MI associated with consuming less than 1, 1, 2 to 3, and 4 or more cups of coffee per day were 1.00 (reference), 0.99 (0.69-1.44), 1.36 (1.01-1.83), and 1.64 (1.14-2.34), respectively. Corresponding ORs (95{\%} CIs) for individuals with the rapid *1A/*1A genotype were 1.00, 0.75 (0.51-1.12), 0.78 (0.56-1.09), and 0.99 (0.66-1.48) (P = .04 for gene x coffee interaction). For individuals younger than the median age of 59 years, the ORs (95{\%} CIs) associated with consuming less than 1, 1, 2 to 3, or 4 or more cups of coffee per day were 1.00, 1.24 (0.71-2.18), 1.67 (1.08-2.60), and 2.33 (1.39-3.89), respectively, among carriers of the *1F allele. The corresponding ORs (95{\%} CIs) for those with the *1A/*1A genotype were 1.00, 0.48 (0.26-0.87), 0.57 (0.35-0.95), and 0.83 (0.46-1.51). CONCLUSION Intake of coffee was associated with an increased risk of nonfatal MI only among individuals with slow caffeine metabolism, suggesting that caffeine plays a role in this association.},

Personalisation of interventions may be more effective in changing behaviour4 that will affect health outcomes.5 In this article we consider the evidence for personalised nutrition. There is no agreed definition of personalised nutrition. For the purposes of this review, we define it as an approach that uses information on individual characteristics to develop targeted nutritional advice, products, or services. Gibney et al6 describe it as an approach that “assists individuals in achieving a lasting dietary behaviour change that is beneficial for health.” Personalised nutrition partially overlaps with related terms such as precision nutrition, nutrigenomics, nutrigenetics, nutritional genomics, etc (box 1). Box 1 {\#}{\#}{\#} Descriptors and definitions In common with other scientific fields in their early development, multiple concepts and descriptors are used in personalised nutrition, sometimes without rigorous definition. In addition to the term personalised nutrition, many other terms are used—for example, precision nutrition, stratified nutrition, tailored nutrition, and individually tailored nutrition. We have attempted to group the descriptors as follows: • Stratified and tailored nutrition are similar (if not synonymous). These approaches attempt to group individuals with shared characteristics and to deliver nutritional intervention/advice that is suited to each group • Personalised nutrition and individually tailored nutrition mean similar things and go a step further by attempting to deliver nutritional intervention/advice suited to each individual • Precision nutrition is the most ambitious of the descriptors.

However, replication has been very low. Our aim was to study the interaction between a functional APOA2 polymorphism, food intake and body mass index (BMI) in independent populations to replicate findings and to increase their evidence level. Methods—Cross-sectional, follow-up (20 years) and case-control analyses were undertaken in three independent populations. We analyzed gene-diet interactions between the APOA2 -265T{\textgreater}C polymorphism and saturated fat (SATFAT) intake on BMI and obesity in 3,462 subjects from three American populations: Framingham (1,454 Whites), GOLDN (1,078 Whites) and Boston-Puerto Rican studies (930 Hispanics of Caribbean origin). Results—Prevalence of CC subjects ranged from 11-15{\%}. We identified statistically significant interactions between the APOA2 -265T{\textgreater}C and SATFAT on BMI in all three populations. Thus, the magnitude of the difference in BMI between the CC and TT+TC subjects differed by SATFAT. A mean increase of 6.2{\%} BMI (ranging from 4.3{\%}-7.9{\%}; P{\textless}0.05), was observed between genotypes with high ({\textgreater}=22g/d), but not with low SATFAT intake in all studies. Likewise, the CC genotype was significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence in all populations only in the high-SATFAT stratum. Meta-analysis estimations of obesity for CC compared with TT+TC subjects were: OR=1.84, 95{\%}CI:1.38-2.47; P{\textless}0.0001 in the high-SATFAT stratum, but no association was detected in the low-SATFAT stratum (OR=0.81, 95{\%}CI:0.59-1.11;P=0.181). Conclusions—For the first time, a gene-diet interaction influencing BMI and obesity has been strongly and consistently replicated in three independent populations.},

To identify new loci influencing glycemic traits, we performed meta-analyses of 21 genome-wide association studies informative for fasting glucose, fasting insulin and indices of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to 46,186 nondiabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558 additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with fasting glucose and HOMA-B and two loci associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. These include nine loci newly associated with fasting glucose (in or near ADCY5, MADD, ADRA2A, CRY2, FADS1, GLIS3, SLC2A2, PROX1 and C2CD4B) and one influencing fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (near IGF1). We also demonstrated association of ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR and DGKB-TMEM195 with type 2 diabetes. Within these loci, likely biological candidate genes influence signal transduction, cell proliferation, development, glucose-sensing and circadian regulation. Our results demonstrate that genetic studies of glycemic traits can identify type 2 diabetes risk loci, as well as loci containing gene variants that are associated with a modest elevation in glucose levels but are not associated with overt diabetes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The common variants in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Recently, studies also linked FTO variants with macronutrient intakes. OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate whether diet interventions varying in macronutrients modified the effects of FTO genotypes on changes in insulin resistance. METHODS We genotyped FTO variants rs1558902 and rs9939609 and measured insulin resistance in fasting plasma samples at baseline and at 6-mo and 2-y visits in 743 overweight or obese adults (aged 30-70 y, 60{\%} women) from a randomized weight-loss dietary interventional trial, the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS LOST) trial. We assessed interactions between FTO variants and intakes of dietary fat and protein in relation to change in body weight and insulin resistance using generalized estimating equation models. RESULTS We found significant interactions between rs1558902 and dietary fat on changes in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin (P = 0.003 and 0.004, respectively). Each risk allele (A) of rs1558902 showed a trend to be related to a 0.05-unit less reduction in both log(insulin) and log(HOMA-IR) among the participants assigned to low-fat diets (both P = 0.06), but this was not significantly related to reduction in those assigned to high-fat diets (both P {\textgreater} 0.1) during the 2-y period of intervention. Our data showed that the association between rs9939609 and changes in insulin resistance was not modified by diet macronutrient intakes. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that carriers of the risk alleles of rs1558902 benefit differently in improving insulin sensitivity by consuming high-fat weight-loss diets rather than low-fat diets. Still, given our data, we acknowledge it is difficult to determine whether fat or carbohydrate contributed to the observed associations.},

abstract = {The plasma lipid response to changes in dietary fat and cholesterol can vary between individuals. At present, responders cannot be identified in advance. An adenine to guanine (A→G) mutation in the promoter of the apolipoprotein A1 gene (apoA-1) has been suggested as affecting plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In 50 young men we examined the effect of the same mutation on the responses of both high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-fat diet. The frequency for the A allele was 0{\textperiodcentered}14. Subjects were fed a low-fat diet for 25 days, followed by a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA, 22{\%} out of 40{\%} fat) for 28 days and lipoproteins were measured at the end of each diet. There were no differences in initial total cholesterol between subjects with the G/G mutation (170 mg/dL: 100 mg/dL= 2 59 mmol/L)) and the G/A mutation (169 mg/dL) genotypes. After consumption of the high monounsaturated fat diet, significant increases were noted in plasma LDL cholesterol (10 mg/dL, p = 0{\textperiodcentered}035) in the G/A subjects but not in the G/G subjects (1 mg/dL, p=0{\textperiodcentered}996). These differences showed that a significant diet-gene interaction (p=0{\textperiodcentered}015) existed. No differences were observed on HDL cholesterol between groups. Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol responsiveness to diet may be explained by variation at the apoA-I gene locus. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by the American Diabetes Association. OBJECTIVE A common variant rs236918 in the PCSK7 gene has the strongest association with iron homeostasis and is related to insulin resistance. Dietary carbohydrate (CHO) modulates the genetic effect on insulin resistance. We examined whether 2-year weight-loss diets modify the effect of PCSK7 genetic variants on changes in fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance in a randomized, controlled trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were analyzed in the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS LOST) trial, which is a randomized, controlled 2-year weight-loss trial using diets that differed inmacronutrient proportions. PCSK7 rs236918 was genotyped in 730 overweight or obese adults (80{\%} whites) in this trial. We assessed the progression in fasting insulin and glucose levels, and insulin resistance by genotypes. RESULTS During the 6-month weight-loss phase, the PCSK7 rs236918 G allele was significantly associated with greater decreases in fasting insulin levels in the high- dietary CHO group (P for interaction = 0.04), while the interaction for changes in HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (P for interaction = 0.06) did not reach significant levels in white subjects. The G allele was significantly associated with a greater decrease in fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR in response to high dietary CHO levels (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively). From 6 months to 2 years (weight-regain phase), the interactions became attenuated due to the regaining of weight (P for interactions = 0.08 and 0.06, respectively). In addition, we observed similar and even stronger results in the whole-study samples from the trial. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that PCSK7 genotypes may interact with dietary CHO intake on changes in insulin sensitivity in the white Americans.},

abstract = {Blood pressure is a heritable trait influenced by several biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli. Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (≥140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure). Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2, GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Temporal increases in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages have paralleled the rise in obesity prevalence, but whether the intake of such beverages interacts with the genetic predisposition to adiposity is unknown. METHODS We analyzed the interaction between genetic predisposition and the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages in relation to body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and obesity risk in 6934 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and in 4423 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and also in a replication cohort of 21,740 women from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS). The genetic-predisposition score was calculated on the basis of 32 BMI-associated loci. The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was examined prospectively in relation to BMI. RESULTS In the NHS and HPFS cohorts, the genetic association with BMI was stronger among participants with higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages than among those with lower intake. In the combined cohorts, the increases in BMI per increment of 10 risk alleles were 1.00 for an intake of less than one serving per month, 1.12 for one to four servings per month, 1.38 for two to six servings per week, and 1.78 for one or more servings per day (P{\textless}0.001 for interaction). For the same categories of intake, the relative risks of incident obesity per increment of 10 risk alleles were 1.19 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.59), 1.67 (95{\%} CI, 1.28 to 2.16), 1.58 (95{\%} CI, 1.01 to 2.47), and 5.06 (95{\%} CI, 1.66 to 15.5) (P=0.02 for interaction). In the WGHS cohort, the increases in BMI per increment of 10 risk alleles were 1.39, 1.64, 1.90, and 2.53 across the four categories of intake (P=0.001 for interaction); the relative risks for incident obesity were 1.40 (95{\%} CI, 1.19 to 1.64), 1.50 (95{\%} CI, 1.16 to 1.93), 1.54 (95{\%} CI, 1.21 to 1.94), and 3.16 (95{\%} CI, 2.03 to 4.92), respectively (P=0.007 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS The genetic association with adiposity appeared to be more pronounced with greater intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).},

abstract = {Individual variability in drug efficacy and drug safety is a major challenge in current clinical practice, drug development, and drug regulation. For more than 5 decades, studies of pharmacogenetics have provided ample examples of causal relations between genotypes and drug response to account for phenotypic variations of clinical importance in drug therapy. The convergence of pharmacogenetics and human genomics in recent years has dramatically accelerated the discovery of new genetic variations that potentially underlie variability in drug response, giving birth to pharmacogenomics. In addition to the rapid accumulation of knowledge on genome-disease and genome-drug interactions, there arises the hope of individualized medicine. Here we review recent progress in the understanding of genetic contributions to major individual variability in drug therapy with focus on genetic variations of drug target, drug metabolism, drug transport, disease susceptibility, and drug safety. Challenges to future pharmacogenomics and its translation into individualized medicine, drug development, and regulation are discussed. For example, knowledge on genetic determinants of disease pathogenesis and drug action, especially those of complex disease and drug response, is not always available. Relating the many gene variations from genomic sequencing to clinical phenotypes may not be straightforward. It is often very challenging to conduct large scale, prospective studies to establish causal associations between genetic variations and drug response or to evaluate the utility and cost-effectiveness of genomic medicine. Overcoming the obstacles holds promise for achieving the ultimate goal of effective and safe medication to targeted patients with appropriate genotypes.},

abstract = {The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a large and complex clinical investigation of strategies for the prevention and control of some of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among postmenopausal women, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporotic fractures. The WHI was initiated in 1992, with a planned completion date of 2007. Postmenopausal women ranging in age from 50 to 79 are enrolled at one of 40 WHI clinical centers nationwide into either a clinical trial (CT) that will include about 64,500 women or an observational study (OS) that will include about 100,000 women. The CT is designed to allow randomized controlled evaluation of three distinct interventions: a low-fat eating pattern, hypothesized to prevent breast cancer and colorectal cancer and, secondarily, coronary heart disease; hormone replacement therapy, hypothesized to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases and, secondarily, to reduce the risk of hip and other fractures, with increased breast cancer risk as a possible adverse outcome; and calcium and vitamin D supplementation, hypothesized to prevent hip fractures and, secondarily, other fractures and colorectal cancer. Overall benefit-versus-risk assessment is a central focus in each of the three CT components. Women are screened for participation in one or both of the components—dietary modification (DM) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)—of the CT, which will randomize 48,000 and 27,500 women, respectively. Women who prove to be ineligible for, or who are unwilling to enroll in, these CT components are invited to enroll in the OS. At their 1-year anniversary of randomization, CT women are invited to be further randomized into the calcium and vitamin D (CaD) trial component, which is projected to include 45,000 women. The average follow-up for women in either CT or OS is approximately 9 years. Concerted efforts are made to enroll women of racial and ethnic minority groups, with a target of 20{\%} of overall enrollment in both the CT and OS. This article gives a brief description of the rationale for the interventions being studied in each of the CT components and for the inclusion of the OS component. Some detail is provided on specific study design choices, including eligibility criteria, recruitment strategy, and sample size, with attention to the partial factorial design of the CT. Some aspects of the CT monitoring approach are also outlined. The scientific and logistic complexity of the WHI implies particular leadership and management challenges. The WHI organization and committee structure employed to respond to these challenges is also briefly described.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a protein of the innate immune system hypothesized to mediate some of the effects of a high-fat diet on inflammation and insulin resistance. As both these factors are associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS), genetic variation in TLR4 may affect the relationship between dietary lipids and MetS. The objective of the study was to determine whether 2 polymorphisms in TLR4 (rs4986790 Asp299Gly and rs5030728 G{\textgreater}A) modify the relationship between dietary fat and markers of the MetS. Participants were healthy young men and women of various ethnocultural backgrounds. Dietary intake was estimated using a 1-month semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, and fasting blood samples were taken for genotyping and biomarker measurement. The Asp299Gly polymorphism in TLR4 was associated with increased insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (P {\textless}.05), and homeostasis model assessment of $\beta$-cell function (P {\textless}.05) and family history of diabetes (P =.0002). The intronic polymorphism rs5030728 modified the relationship between dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P =.003 for interaction). The SFA intake was inversely associated with HDL cholesterol among individuals homozygous for the G allele ($\beta$ = -0.015 ± 0.007 mmol/L, P =.04), whereas a positive relationship was observed for heterozygotes ($\beta$ = 0.025 ± 0.01 mmol/L, P =.02). There was no association between dietary SFAs and HDL cholesterol among individuals homozygous for the A allele. These observations suggest that both diet and innate immunity may interact to influence components of the MetS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We also explain how simple adjustments to standard regression-based methods used in GE GWAS can alleviate this problem.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Twenty-four diabetic patients with the apoE3/3 genotype and 11 diabetic patients with the apoE4/3 genotype were recruited. Participants were hospitalized for calorie-restricted diet therapy (25.0 kcal {\{}middle dot{\}} kg body wt-1 {\{}middle dot{\}} day-1) for 14 days. Body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and plasma lipid levels on hospital days 1 and 14 were compared between the two apoE genotype groups. RESULTS--There were no significant differences in baseline FPG levels, HbA1c levels, BMI, and plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol between the two apoE genotype groups, but baseline plasma levels of LDL cholesterol were significantly higher in the apoE4/3 group than in the apoE3/3 group. Body weight decreased slightly and FPG levels decreased significantly after diet therapy in both apoE genotype groups. In the apoE3/3 group, only plasma levels of triglyceride decreased significantly after diet therapy, whereas in the apoE4/3 group, plasma levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol decreased significantly after diet therapy. The decrease (percentage of change) in total cholesterol (-16.3 vs. -6.6{\%}) and LDL cholesterol (-15.6 vs. -0.7{\%}) after diet therapy was significantly greater in the apoE4/3 group than in the apoE3/3 group. CONCLUSIONS--Calorie-restricted diet therapy is more effective in reducing plasma LDL cholesterol in type 2 diabetic patients with the apoE4 allele.},

Although commonly thought of as 2 separate disease entities, CVD and cancer possess various similarities and possible interactions, including a number of similar risk factors (eg, obesity, diabetes mellitus), suggesting a shared biology for which there is emerging evidence. Although chronic inflammation is an indispensable feature of the pathogenesis and progression of both CVD and cancer, additional mechanisms can be found at their intersection. Therapeutic advances, despite improving longevity, have increased the overlap between these diseases, with millions of cancer survivors now at risk of developing CVD. Cardiac risk factors have a major impact on subsequent treatment-related cardiotoxicity. In this review, we explore the risk factors common to both CVD and cancer, highlighting the major epidemiological studies and potential biological mechanisms that account for them.},

Little is known about whether cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) genetic variation may modify the effect of weight-loss diets varying in fat content on changes in lipid levels. We analyzed the interaction between the CETP variant rs3764261 and dietary interventions on changes in lipid levels among 732 overweight/obese adults from a 2 year randomized weight-loss trial [Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS LOST)], and replicated the findings in 171 overweight/obese adults from an independent 2 year weight-loss trial [Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT)] . In the POUNDS LOST, participants with the CETP rs3764261 CC genotype on the high-fat diet had larger increases in HDL cholesterol (P = 0.001) and decreases in triglycerides (P = 0.007) than those on the low-fat diet at 6 months, while no significant difference between these two diets was observed among participants carrying other genotypes. The gene-diet interactions on changes in HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were replicated in the DIRECT (pooled P for interaction ≤ 0.01). Similar results on trajectory of changes in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides over the 2 year intervention were observed in bo th trials. Our study provides replicable evidence that individuals with the CETP rs3764261 CC genotype might derive greater effects on raising HDL cholesterol and lowering triglycerides by choosing a low-carbohydrate/high-fat weight-loss diet instead of a low-fat diet.},

abstract = {PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for even faster and more scalable implementations of key functions. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain probabilistic calls, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(sqrt(n))-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. This will be followed by PLINK 2.0, which will introduce (a) a new data format capable of efficiently representing probabilities, phase, and multiallelic variants, and (b) extensions of many functions to account for the new types of information. The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally important variants. To fill these unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a 'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min to perform gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day. ANNOVAR is freely available at http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/.},

Interactions of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on these associations are unknown. We investigated whether the TCF7L2-rs7903146 (C{\textgreater}T) polymorphism associations with type 2 diabetes, glucose, lipids, and cardiovascular disease incidence were modulated by MedDiet. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSA randomized trial (two MedDiet intervention groups and a control group) on 7,018 participants in the PREvencion con DIetaMEDiterranea study was undertaken and major cardiovascular events assessed. Data were analyzed at baseline and after a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for cardiovascular events. RESULTSThe TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism was associated with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.87 [95{\%} CI 1.62-2.17] for TT compared with CC). MedDiet interacted significantly with rs7903146 on fasting glucose at baseline (P interaction = 0.004). When adherence to the MedDiet was low, TT had higher fasting glucose concentrations (132.3 {\{}+/-{\}} 3.5 mg/dL) than CC+CT (127.3 {\{}+/-{\}} 3.2 mg/dL) individuals (P = 0.001). Nevertheless, when adherence was high, this increase was not observed (P = 0.605). This modulation was also detected for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (P interaction {\textless} 0.05 for all). Likewise, in the randomized trial, TT subjects had a higher stroke incidence in the control group (adjusted HR 2.91 [95{\%} CI 1.36-6.19]; P = 0.006 compared with CC), whereas dietary intervention with MedDiet reduced stroke incidence in TT homozygotes (adjusted HR 0.96 [95{\%} CI 0.49-1.87]; P = 0.892 for TT compared with CC). CONCLUSIONSOur novel results suggest that MedDiet may not only reduce increased fasting glucose and lipids in TT individuals, but also stroke incidence.},

Inverse association between all-cause mortality and LDL-C was seen in 16 cohorts (in 14 with statistical significance) representing 92{\%} of the number of participants, where this association was recorded. In the rest, no association was found. In two cohorts, CV mortality was highest in the lowest LDL-C quartile and with statistical significance; in seven cohorts, no association was found.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nConclusions High LDL-C is inversely associated with mortality in most people over 60 years. This finding is inconsistent with the cholesterol hypothesis (ie, that cholesterol, particularly LDL-C, is inherently atherogenic). Since elderly people with high LDL-C live as long or longer than those with low LDL-C, our analysis provides reason to question the validity of the cholesterol hypothesis. Moreover, our study provides the rationale for a re-evaluation of guidelines recommending pharmacological reduction of LDL-C in the elderly as a component of cardiovascular disease prevention strategies.},

Specifically, we examined: 1) the impact of this program on 55 clinical markers and 2) the effect of genetic predisposition on these clinical changes. We identified sustained improvements in clinical markers related to cardiometabolic risk, inflammation, nutrition, and anthropometrics. Notably, improvements in HbA1c were akin to those observed in landmark trials. Furthermore, genetic markers were associated with longitudinal changes in clinical markers. For example, individuals with genetic predisposition for higher LDL-C had a lesser decrease in LDL-C on average than those with genetic predisposition for average LDL-C. Overall, these results suggest that a program combining multi-omic data with lifestyle coaching produces clinically meaningful improvements, and that genetic predisposition impacts clinical responses to lifestyle change.},

abstract = {The vast majority of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are performed in Europeans, and their transferability to other populations is dependent on many factors (e.g., linkage disequilibrium, allele frequencies, genetic architecture). As medical genomics studies become increasingly large and diverse, gaining insights into population history and consequently the transferability of disease risk measurement is critical. Here, we disentangle recent population history in the widely used 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, with an emphasis on populations underrepresented in medical studies. To examine the transferability of single-ancestry GWASs, we used published summary statistics to calculate polygenic risk scores for eight well-studied phenotypes. We identify directional inconsistencies in all scores; for example, height is predicted to decrease with genetic distance from Europeans, despite robust anthropological evidence that West Africans are as tall as Europeans on average. To gain deeper quantitative insights into GWAS transferability, we developed a complex trait coalescent-based simulation framework considering effects of polygenicity, causal allele frequency divergence, and heritability. As expected, correlations between true and inferred risk are typically highest in the population from which summary statistics were derived. We demonstrate that scores inferred from European GWASs are biased by genetic drift in other populations even when choosing the same causal variants and that biases in any direction are possible and unpredictable. This work cautions that summarizing findings from large-scale GWASs may have limited portability to other populations using standard approaches and highlights the need for generalized risk prediction methods and the inclusion of more diverse individuals in medical genomics.},

We tested interactions between these dietary factors and approximately 2.7 million genetic variants for colorectal cancer risk among 9,287 cases and 9,117 controls from ten studies. We used logistic regression to investigate multiplicative gene-diet interactions, as well as our recently developed Cocktail method that involves a screening step based on marginal associations and gene-diet correlations and a testing step for multiplicative interactions, while correcting for multiple testing using weighted hypothesis testing. Per quartile increment in the intake of red and processed meat were associated with statistically significant increased risks of colorectal cancer and vegetable, fruit and fiber intake with lower risks. From the case-control analysis, we detected a significant interaction between rs4143094 (10p14/near GATA3) and processed meat consumption (OR = 1.17; p = 8.7E-09), which was consistently observed across studies (p heterogeneity = 0.78). The risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat was increased among individuals with the rs4143094-TG and -TT genotypes (OR = 1.20 and OR = 1.39, respectively) and null among those with the GG genotype (OR = 1.03). Our results identify a novel gene-diet interaction with processed meat for colorectal cancer, highlighting that diet may modify the effect of genetic variants on disease risk, which may have important implications for prevention.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is the largest research program ever initiated in the United States with a focus on diet and health. Therefore, it is important to understand and document the measurement characteristics of the key dietary assessment instrument: the WHI food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). METHODS: Data are from 113 women screened for participation in the WHI in 1995. We assessed bias and precision of the FFQ by comparing the intake of 30 nutrients estimated from the FFQ with means from four 24-hour dietary recalls and a 4-day food record. RESULTS: For most nutrients, means estimated by the FFQ were within 10{\%} of the records or recalls. Precision, defined as the correlation between the FFQ and the records and recalls, was similar to other FFQs. Energy adjusted correlation coefficients ranged from 0.2 (vitamin B12) to 0.7 (magnesium) with a mean of 0.5. The correlation for percentage energy from fat (a key measure in WHI) was 0.6. Vitamin supplement use was common. For example, almost half of total vitamin E intake was obtained from supplements. Including supplemental vitamins and minerals increased micronutrient correlation coefficients, which ranged from 0.2 (thiamin) to 0.8 (vitamin E) with a mean of 0.6. CONCLUSIONS: The WHI FFQ produced nutrient estimates that were similar to those obtained from short-term dietary recall and recording methods. Comparison of WHI FFQ nutrient intake measures to independent and unbiased measures, such as doubly labeled water estimates of energy expenditure, are needed to help address the validity of the FFQ in this population.},

abstract = {The identification of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction in human traits and diseases is an active area of research that generates high expectation, and most often lead to high disappointment. This is partly explained by a misunderstanding of the inherent characteristics of standard regression-based interaction analyses. Here, I revisit and untangle major theoretical aspects of interaction tests in the special case of linear regression; in particular, I discuss variables coding scheme, interpretation of effect estimate, statistical power, and estimation of variance explained in regard of various hypothetical interaction patterns. Linking this components it appears first that the simplest biological interaction models-in which the magnitude of a genetic effect depends on a common exposure-are among the most difficult to identify. Second, I highlight the demerit of the current strategy to evaluate the contribution of interaction effects to the variance of quantitative outcomes and argue for the use of new approaches to overcome this issue. Finally, I explore the advantages and limitations of multivariate interaction models, when testing for interaction between multiple SNPs and/or multiple exposures, over univariate approaches. Together, these new insights can be leveraged for future method development and to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of multifactorial traits.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Society for Nutrition. Background: Hepatic lipase (HL) plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of HDL and LDL. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified common variants in the HL gene (LIPC) associated with HDL cholesterol. Objective: We tested the effect of a common variant in LIPC on changes in blood lipids in response to weight-loss diets in the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies Trial. Methods: We genotyped LIPC rs2070895 in 743 overweight or obese adults aged 30-70 y (61{\%} women) who were assigned to high-fat (40{\%} energy) or low-fat (20{\%} energy) diets for 2 y. We measured serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol at baseline and 2 y of intervention. Results: At 2 y of intervention, dietary fat modified effects of the variant on changes in serum TC, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (P-interaction: 0.0008, 0.004, and 0.03, respectively). In the low-fat group, as compared to the G allele, the A allele tended to be related to the decrease in TC and LDL cholesterol concentrations [TC ($\beta$ ± SE): -5.5 ± 3.0, P = 0.07; LDL cholesterol: -4.8 ± 2.5, P = 0.06] and a lower increase in HDL cholesterol concentrations ($\beta$ ± SE: -1.37 ± 0.69, P = 0.048), whereas an opposite effect in the high-fat diet group was evident [TC ($\beta$ ± SE): 7.3 ± 2.7, P = 0.008; LDL cholesterol: 4.1 ± 2.3, P = 0.07], and there was no genetic effect on changes in HDL cholesterol concentrations (P = 0.54). Conclusion: Dietary fat intake modifies the effect of a common variant in LIPC on changes in serum lipids during a long-term weight-loss intervention in overweight or obese adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00072995.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Dietary intervention (DI) is a primary strategy to attenuate some of the metabolic abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), including low HDL cholesterol. There is no biomarker that can identify individuals who respond to DI by increasing HDL cholesterol. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the predictive power of a genetic predisposition score (GPS) in Mexican adults with MetS to identify HDL cholesterol responders to DI. METHODS This study followed a prospective cohort design. Sixty-seven Mexican adults aged 20-60 y (21{\%} men) with BMI ≥25 and ≤39.9 kg/m², who had at least 3 of 5 positive criteria for MetS, were included. Participants consumed a low saturated fat diet for 2.5 mo ({\textless}7{\%} energy as saturated fat, {\textless}200 mg of cholesterol/d) and reduced their usual diet by ∼440 kcal/d, a reduction in total energy intake of about 25{\%}. Anthropometry and serum biochemical markers, including HDL cholesterol, were measured before and after DI. A multilocus GPS was constructed using previously reported genetic variants associated with response to diet in subjects with MetS. GPS values, designed to predict the response of HDL cholesterol to the DI, were computed for each individual as the sum of the number of effect alleles across 14 SNPs. RESULTS Individuals were dichotomized as high and low GPS according to median GPS (-2.12) and we observed a difference in HDL cholesterol changes on DI of +3 mg/dL (6.3{\%}) in subjects with low GPS, whereas those with high GPS had HDL cholesterol decreases of -3 mg/dL (-7.9{\%}) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Individuals with low GPS showed greater increases in their HDL cholesterol than those with high GPS. Therefore, the GPS can be useful for predicting the HDL cholesterol response to diet.},

abstract = {Age-related changes in DNA methylation have been implicated in cellular senescence and longevity, yet the causes and functional consequences of these variants remain unclear. To elucidate the role of age-related epigenetic changes in healthy ageing and potential longevity, we tested for association between whole-blood DNA methylation patterns in 172 female twins aged 32 to 80 with age and age-related phenotypes. Twin-based DNA methylation levels at 26,690 CpG-sites showed evidence for mean genome-wide heritability of 18{\%}, which was supported by the identification of 1,537 CpG-sites with methylation QTLs in cis at FDR 5{\%}. We performed genome-wide analyses to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs) for sixteen age-related phenotypes (ap-DMRs) and chronological age (a-DMRs). Epigenome-wide association scans (EWAS) identified age-related phenotype DMRs (ap-DMRs) associated with LDL (STAT5A), lung function (WT1), and maternal longevity (ARL4A, TBX20). In contrast, EWAS for chronological age identified hundreds of predominantly hyper-methylated age DMRs (490 a-DMRs at FDR 5{\%}), of which only one (TBX20) was also associated with an age-related phenotype. Therefore, the majority of age-related changes in DNA methylation are not associated with phenotypic measures of healthy ageing in later life. We replicated a large proportion of a-DMRs in a sample of 44 younger adult MZ twins aged 20 to 61, suggesting that a-DMRs may initiate at an earlier age. We next explored potential genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying a-DMRs and ap-DMRs. Genome-wide overlap across cis-meQTLs, genotype-phenotype associations, and EWAS ap-DMRs identified CpG-sites that had cis-meQTLs with evidence for genotype-phenotype association, where the CpG-site was also an ap-DMR for the same phenotype. Monozygotic twin methylation difference analyses identified one potential environmentally-mediated ap-DMR associated with total cholesterol and LDL (CSMD1). Our results suggest that in a small set of genes DNA methylation may be a candidate mechanism of mediating not only environmental, but also genetic effects on age-related phenotypes.},

Methods:One hundred ninety seven type 2 diabetes patients and 212 healthy controls were enrolled. Among them, 67 type 2 diabetes patients were administered pioglitazone (30 mg/d, po) for 3 months. All the subjects were genotyped for genetic variants in PPAR-$\gamma$2 and PTPRD using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were determined. Results:The PPAR-$\gamma$2 gene rs1801282 polymorphism was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility (OR=0.515, 95{\%} CI 0.268-0.990) and the PTPRD gene rs17584499 polymorphism was also significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (OR=1.984, 95{\%} CI 1.135-3.469) in a dominant model adjusted for age, gender and BMI. After pioglitazone treatment for 3 months, the type 2 diabetes patients with PPAR-$\gamma$2 rs1801282 CG genotypes significantly showed higher differential values of postprandial plasma glucose and serum triglyceride compared with those with rs1801282 CC genotype. The patients with PTPRD rs17584499 CT+TT genotypes showed significantly lower differential value of postprandial plasma glucose compared to those with rs17584499 CC genotype. Conclusion:Diabetes risk alleles in PPAR-$\gamma$2 (rs1801282) and PTPRD (rs17584499) are associated with pioglitazone therapeutic efficacy. {\textcopyright} 2013 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statins are effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, but variability in response is not well understood. To address this, 5745 individuals from the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial were genotyped in a combination of a whole-genome and candidate gene approach to identify associations with response to atorvastatin treatment.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 291 988 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1984 individuals were analyzed for association with statin response, followed by genotyping top hits in 3761 additional individuals. None was significant at the whole-genome level in either the initial or follow-up test sets for association with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglyceride response. In addition to the whole-genome platform, 23 candidate genes previously associated with statin response were analyzed in these 5745 individuals. Three SNPs in apoE were most highly associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response, followed by 1 in PCSK9 with a similar effect size. At the candidate gene level, SNPs in HMGCR were also significant though the effect was less than with those in apoE and PCSK9. rs7412/apoE had the most significant association (P=6x10(-30)), and its high significance in the whole-genome study (P=4x10(-9)) confirmed the suitability of this population for detecting effects. Age and gender were found to influence low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to a similar extent as the most pronounced genetic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Among SNPs tested with an allele frequency of at least 5{\%}, only SNPs in apoE are found to influence statin response significantly. Less frequent variants in PCSK9 and smaller effect sizes in SNPs in HMGCR were also revealed},

abstract = {Genetic variants responsible for susceptibility to obesity and its comorbidities among Hispanic children have not been identified. The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study was designed to genetically map childhood obesity and associated biological processes in the Hispanic population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) entailed genotyping 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Infinium technology in 815 children. Measured genotype analysis was performed between genetic markers and obesity-related traits i.e., anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet, energy expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activity. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1). Salient findings include a nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513) in INADL (p = 1.2E-07) for weight; an intronic variant in MTNR1B associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.7E-08); variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region associated with triglycerides (p = 2.5-4.8E-08); an intronic variant in PCSK2 associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08); a block of 23 SNPs in XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) associated with serum TSH (p = 5.5E-08 to 1.0E-09); a nonsynonymous SNP (p = 1.3E-21), an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC identified for MCP-1; an intronic variant in ARHGAP11A associated with sleep duration (p = 5.0E-08); and, after adjusting for body weight, variants in MATK for total energy expenditure (p = 2.7E-08) and in CHRNA3 for sleeping energy expenditure (p = 6.0E-08). Unprecedented phenotyping and high-density SNP genotyping enabled localization of novel genetic loci associated with the pathophysiology of childhood obesity.},

abstract = {Functional genomics data has the potential to increase GWAS power by identifying SNPs that have a higher prior probability of association. Here, we introduce a method that leverages polygenic functional enrichment to incorporate coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related genomic annotations into association analyses. We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, functionally informed novel discovery of risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9{\%}–38{\%} increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N = 130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13{\%} increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20{\%} increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p values that do not use functional data. We replicated the additional loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66–0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N = 416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci. In conclusion, leveraging functional enrichment using our method robustly increases GWAS power.},

abstract = {Background: Dietary fat composition can affect ectopic lipid accumulation and, thereby, insulin resistance. Diets that are high in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have different metabolic responses.Objective: We investigated whether the epigenome of human adipose tissue is affected differently by dietary fat composition and general overfeeding in a randomized trial.Design: We studied the effects of 7 wk of excessive SFA (n = 17) or PUFA (n = 14) intake (+750 kcal/d) on the DNA methylation of ∼450,000 sites in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Both diets resulted in similar body weight increases. We also combined the data from the 2 groups to examine the overall effect of overfeeding on the DNA methylation in adipose tissue.Results: The DNA methylation of 4875 Cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites was affected differently between the 2 diets. Furthermore, both the SFA and PUFA diets increased the mean degree of DNA methylation in adipose tissue, particularly in promoter regions. However, although the mean methylation was changed in 1797 genes [e.g., alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase (FTO), interleukin 6 (IL6), insulin receptor (INSR), neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)] by PUFAs, only 125 genes [e.g., adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing (ADIPOQ)] were changed by SFA overfeeding. In addition, the SFA diet significantly altered the expression of 28 transcripts [e.g., acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1)], whereas the PUFA diet did not significantly affect gene expression. When the data from the 2 diet groups were combined, the mean methylation of 1444 genes, including fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1), fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2), melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), MC3R, PPARG coactivator 1 $\alpha$ (PPARGC1A), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), was changed in adipose tissue by overfeeding. Moreover, the baseline DNA methylation of 12 CpG sites that was annotated to 9 genes [e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7), melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), and splicing factor SWAP homolog (SFRS8)] was associated with the degree of weight increase in response to extra energy intake.Conclusions: SFA overfeeding and PUFA overfeeding induce distinct epigenetic changes in human adipose tissue. In addition, we present data that suggest that baseline DNA methylation can predict weight increase in response to overfeeding in humans. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01427140.},
